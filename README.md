## Exercise 1
The two figures here ([fig1](fig1.PNG) and [fig2](fig2.PNG)), are showing the finished design of a webpage. Take a few minutes to define semantic sections of the webpage, using the default semantic HTML5 tags. Discuss these in class

## Exercise 2
Use the [provided file](exercise2.html) to replace all `div's` with the equivalent semantic HTML5 tags. Use *internal* css to change the background color of each type of tag.

## Exercise 3
At the bottom of the page, add a form that users may use to request a price quote to be emailed to them about a place. The information the user should provide should be the following:

- Name (surname , first-names)
- Address (multiple lines)
- email address
- Destination that the price quote is about (Pelion, Trikeri), one of the two exclusively
- How the user heard about this webpage (friends, TV advertisement, visit at the shop, newspaper). This should be multiple choice.

No functionality should be added at the form right now.
